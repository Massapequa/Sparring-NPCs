***Massapequa's fihting NPCs***

This is a small script that is meant to add a little bit of liveliness to your cities by creating town NPCs that fight with eachother.

The script comes with:
BaseScrapper - This is the Base NPC that the other NPCs expand from. They find other Base Scrappers in range (or training bummies) and begin to fight. Once a base scrapper has found an opponent, it'll lock in place and continue fighting.
If the scrapper has a human bodyvalue, it will detect which kind of weapon it is using and give it the correct attack animation.

Sparring Soldier - Heavily armored soldiers with a sword and shield.
Tavern Brawler - Aggressive townsfolk that fist fight one another.
Sparring Fighter - Pit fighters that can spawn with a variety of weapons.
Spectator - NPCs that cheer on fighters and will comment on the fight.
